# Increda – Scrum Management App

Increda is a Scrum management application designed to help teams plan, track, and organize their work incrementally.

The application is built using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React** for the frontend, providing a smooth and responsive experience for managing Scrum boards, sprints, and tasks.

# What I Learned

During the development of Increda, I deepened my understanding of full-stack application development. I gained experience in:  

- Structuring RESTful APIs with Spring Boot  
- Managing application state and UI with React  
- Designing clean, maintainable, and modular code  
- Connecting frontend and backend via HTTP requests  
- Using version control effectively with Git and GitHub  

This project reinforced the importance of incremental development — building small, testable features and iterating on them to improve functionality and usability.

# Demo

The app allows users to:  

- Create Scrum boards and sprints  
- Add, edit, and assign tasks  
- Track progress visually with kanban-style boards  
- Update task status dynamically

# How Increda Was Made

The development started by defining the backend architecture using Spring Boot, setting up controllers, services, and repositories to handle tasks and sprints. The frontend was built in React, connecting to the backend via REST APIs. Features were implemented incrementally, following a Scrum-inspired approach to the project itself.
